    <h2>French Horn project and Revision</h2>
    <p>
      The first website wasn't big enough and didn't fill the whole page. I was told that I should get a transparent french horn background and add
      contrast with the text in header. I was also told that I should make the nav bar be darker with background. I was also told that I should create
      a varing patern. Also make table footer bigger for readability. I was told that I need to make the sections pop out for home and about page.
    </p>
    <p>
      I added more content to expand out the website. I found a different image that was transparent and what I was looking for. I of course added the contact page and will
      need to change the nav bar links to slightly darker for readability. I also changed the text color for the main heading for a little visibility.
      I added a slideshow with pictures of french horns and added lines to the other h3 segments.

    <h2>Thoughts on Progresive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>
      It is the process where you take content and slowly add layers via css then javascript. This allows others to obtain what is can't be
      seen without javascript. It works well because instead of start with a complicated mess you start with a simple task. After you make the
      simple task you add more to it so it can look nice. After you make it look nice then you add on extra features that are nice but it can do
      without. If it can't use the features then it goes to the original presentation.
